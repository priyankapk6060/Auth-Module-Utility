# Auth-Module-Utility
Login-Module-Utility-Development: A plug-and-play login module that can be easily integrated with any of the in-house developed applications by simply including few lines of code.
Download the zip-file, to see the code of the login-module. The full-fledged working module is not available right now. It will be updated soon.

In the auth-module, I integrated **SendGrid**, an open-source SMTP solution, to simulate transactional email flows such as password reset and user sign-up confirmation. This enabled seamless handling of email-based authentication events during development and testing. The backend is built using **Express.js**, providing a lightweight and scalable architecture for handling authentication routes and middleware logic.
